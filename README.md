## Cypress on Netlify

Netlify builds run the Cypress end-to-end suite via `@netlify/plugin-cypress`. The plugin uses
the existing `cypress.config.ts` and respects the `CYPRESS_BASE_URL` environment variable, falling
back to the deployed preview URL that Netlify injects. No extra GitHub Action is requiredâ€”tests
execute automatically during the post-build phase of each deploy preview. Run `netlify build`
locally if you want to reproduce the plugin behaviour on your machine.
